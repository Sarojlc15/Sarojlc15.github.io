              <h1 class="articleheading"> Taste of India and Nepal</h1>
              <div class="content">
                <p> For those with strong desire to try spicy foods. Indian and Nepalese cuisine in common have what you’ve looking for. The Taste of India and Nepal, at 330 N Main St, provides you the experience of typical popular Nepalese appetizers, salads, tandoori, rice, curry, naan, deserts and the Buffet in the morning.</p>
                <p> Nepal Sunsari Dharan, a native of Nepal,  owns the restaurant since 2011. It has become a hangout for people who love to eat Indian and Nepalese spicy food in the seven year she has run it. 
                  The restaurant offers its guests a wide range of entertainment options including, but not limited to, live music bands. It also had a kid’s section and approximately 80 available seats for customers. The Taste of India and Nepal is clean and affordable. </p>
                <img src="images/blog1/Inside Blog/taste front.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                <p> The restaurant has each food stations for non vegetarian and vegetarians. Most meals are prepared from fresh, healthy verified ingredients. The restaurant has a experienced and talented chefs in the kitchen.
                  We offer chicken, pork, lamb, and fish. And for dessert,  mango lassi, ice cream, cookies, and different kinds of cakes,” said Sunsari Dharan. “For beverages, we serve soda, milk juice, and chocolate milk, and also offer a buffet every noon.” </p>
                The staffs are all professional, clean, well dressed and helpful.
                <p> The server makes suggestions when we were torn on the dishes and provided recommendations for the better one. The owner of the restaurant was very gentle and friendly. She would often go and talk to the customer and ask if they need any help.  The waiter was so conscious about the food that he often asked questions for suggestions to improve the service or if they need to add more items to their menus. The restaurant also had the home delivery services around Pocatello city.</p>
                The atmosphere of the restaurant was clean and the pleasant smell of flowers on the top of each table was overwhelming. In the free time, all workers were cleaning the tables, chairs or other utensils they had. The owner herself sometimes found to be cleaning in her free time. She was frequently keeping an eye on employees to check whether they cleaned each table after the customer leaves. Their utensils and drink dispensers were organized, and the carpet was very clean. The cozy atmosphere made it a perfect place to eat and bond with family and friends.
                <p>
                <p> The restaurant employees followed the cleaning and sanitation standards set by restaurant managers and officials. The employees in the restaurant were supposed to wear the uniform that should look very clean. There were welcome mats on the doors so that the restaurant could provide a good area for customers to wipe their wet feet before entering the restaurant. Overall the place seemed clean and hygienic.</p>
                “The Taste of India and Nepal might not be the best Asian restaurant in Idaho, but it stands out from other Indian and Nepalese restaurants because it’s cheap,” says Sunsari Dharan.  “Its affordable price attracts customers to give it a try. The buffet is cheap as it just cost $ 10 per person, and it includes beverages.“
                Wondering around the menu I could see that the most expensive dish in the restaurant would cost $25. No one would regret eating there as the dishes were very big and tasty.

                <p> “I am a weekly customer of the restaurant, and I cannot get the service that I get here in any other restaurant,” said Shikhar Karki, a native Nepalese customer of the restaurant. “I eat Thali a lot when I get here and my second favorite food of the restaurant is Biryani and Chicken Tikka Masala,” he added.</p>
                No doubt Sunsari Dharan is satisfied with her family business. Only the ingredients such as species have to be imported from India or Nepal. Since the price of the food grocery is not so high in Pocatello, the business has the profit margin. In short, their hard work and customer value are both matched correctly.
                <p> “I have hardly seen Americans deny to come here again for the spicy food that we provide. Only because of the customer value, we are encouraged to work on making our own, unique, and spicy cuisine in town\,” Sunsari Dharan added.</p>
