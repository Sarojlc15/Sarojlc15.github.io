              <h1 class="articleheading"> Travis Voskamp Struggles with Coffee Roasting</h1>
              <div class="content">
                <p>Two kids are playing hide and seek near the coffee roasters. The beans are dark black, crispy.  Travis Voskamp, the founder of the Leapknot Coffee Roasters is helping incoming customers with his grandfather. On the left wall of the establishment hangs a map of the United States, where states like Texas, Arkansas, and Colorado are circled. </p>
                Voskamp started the coffee roasters in Texas in 2013, but the time was not super convenient,\ he says. “My family was building up. Until now I have experienced a lot, and now life has made me confident to be able to inspire other people to start an independent business.”
                <p> Leapknot coffee is completely different from that found in grocery stores. It is organic, whereas in the local grocery stores, unlike those that rely on chemicals.Voskamp roasts the berry seeds.</p>
                “I came from coal miners and ranchers, so I have brought my family values here in Pocatello too. Everybody likes hard work which is a value not only in Texas but also here in Pocatello. I remember my dad used to say, a good deal is not a good deal unless it is a good deal for everybody. I want to treat people right and care,” Voskamp added.
                <p> He says his work and business\is not possible without the family support and the feedback and suggestions of loyal customers. Voskamp wants roasting coffee to be economically viable, to take care of the staff, and his family. </p>
                <img src="images/blog1/Inside Blog/leapknot.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                <p> “We were stepping away from the job with secure paychecks and started the new job with a brand new name--Leapknot Coffee Roasters,” he says. Everybody has their own instinct. I wish people get inspired by what we’ve been able to do and start doing their own business or work.” </p>
                <p> Leapknot offers coffee from around the world as well, bringing diversity to Pocatello.The African coffee is fruity and Leapknot blends American and African coffee together </p>
                <p> “It’s interesting to decide and change profession, but at the same time, there were challenges and obstacles before starting this job,” Voskamp said. “It’s not easy to establish a business and compete with other companies in town since coffee shops do not rely on a single manufacturer.”</p>
                Leapknot coffee roasters have been able to send coffee to local and Starbucks as well.
                <p> “It is never too late to find out an area, invest as much as it is possible and be an entrepreneur in the city,” Voskamp added.  “Owning a business means one does not have to rely on money from the paycheck at their work. It also establishes the foundation for the upcoming generation.“</p>
                <p> Coffee roasting machines, mugs, t-shirts, brewers, and prepared coffee bags are placed at the front for selling.
                  Travis started his business with a small investment at first and later up to high. The dedication, positive vibes, hard work and his love towards his family, co-workers and the community make him a satisfied entrepreneur.</p>
                <p> “Travis is very personable and has a very inviting friendly demeanor and his business appears to be running very well because of his professionalism and seriousness,” says  Paul M. Dickey, the video instructor at College of Technology.”With the smell of freshly roasted coffee in the air and was very different from what Starbucks provides, the flavor notes are much more distinct.” </p>
                <p> Voskamp wants to encourage other Idahoans to start their own business and live by doing their passions. “It is never too late to start the new business and help the community by providing better services,” he says. </p>
