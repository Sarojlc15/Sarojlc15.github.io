                <p> Saroj is a communication major with an emphasis on multiplatform journalism at ISU. He is working as an intern with CEWT for videographer and video editor position. He is also serving a position of communication officer for Advertising Federation and communication officer and fundraiser at SACAA. Previously, he worked as a public co-ordination for NSA during his first year in the college. </p>
                <p> Lamichhane came from Nepal to ISU with an aim to be a journalist for broadcasting and paper media. He wants to be a foreign correspondent and a television presenter in a recognized media after graduating from ISU. He had also worked as a radio presenter in Nepal during his high school, and involved in media marketing and writing for the film industry. He had won “The Best Entertainer of The Year” award in the last year of his high school, entertaining audiences through his caricature and creative speech on the stage. His friends and colleagues were shocked by his talent. He has also been making short documentaries and interviews video since past few years. Lamichhane has a good knowledge of Adobe Creative Cloud, and for this, he is thankful to his supervisor, Paul M. Dickey, who works as a video instructor at CEWT. Storytelling, reporting, cinematography, movie direction, radio or television presenter, and advanced graphics and video editing are some of his favorite jobs that he would give up to anything. </p>
